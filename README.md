# Webber's Map Editor 2D

⚠️ Pre-alpha, works but doesn't do much yet. ⚠️

## How it works

- Load or create a new map
- Select your sprites' folder (recursively). 
- Drag your sprites to the canvas to create instances.
- On the canvas, adjust instances:
  - 📛 Name 
  - 🪧 Position (x, y)
  - 🔝 Z-Index
  - 🛞 Rotation
  - 🔛 Scale
- Save map as a JSON file (includes relative paths to the files).

[//]: # ( Possible future features )
[//]: # (    - Flip)
[//]: # (    - Color)
[//]: # (    - Opacity)
[//]: # (    - Blend mode)

## Limitations

- Currently only works with files in your home directory, for your own security. 

_Limitations will be lifted in [v2](https://github.com/webbertakken/map-editor-2d/issues/10)._
